With 20 years of experience in corporate IT and one startup behind me, I’ve recently embarked on my second startup, Tikabu, which provides premium consulting services in secure DevOps. Focusing on clients with a predominantly Microsoft technology stack, we help our customers become more agile at delivering solutions to their customers.I’ve been passionate about PowerShell since its beta days. I recognised the potential and flexibility it gave me compared with the tools I started out with in automation, such as Kix and VBScript. Today, I remain a staunch PowerShell devotee; I’ve presented on the scripting language at user groups and am a two-time winner of the Quest PowerPack Challenge. PowerShell has become an integral part of the solutions that I develop day to day. Throughout my career, I’ve served in both technical and people-management positions across the financial sector. My electrical-engineering degree has provided a strong foundation for the analytical and troubleshooting talents necessary for a successful IT career, and my MBA and additional continuing education have given me a broader and more well-informed business outlook. My ongoing thirst for technical knowledge has led to a thorough understanding of technology at all levels. More than just a vocation, technology is my passion both in and out of the workplace.",
